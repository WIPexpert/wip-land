            <h3>WIP’s Public Offer for Individuals (full text)</h3>
            <h3>PUBLIC OFFER AGREEMENT</h3>
            <p>This Public Offer Agreement (the "Agreement") is made between WIP Solutions Inc. ("WIP"), a company organized and operating under the laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, and the individual who accepts this Agreement (the "User").</p>
            <p>By using WIP's services, the User acknowledges having read, understood and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>

            <h3>1. Services Provided</h3>
            <p>WIP offers recruitment-related services (the “Services”), including but not limited to job listings, candidate submission for vacancies, and communication with potential employers, as described on the <a href="http://app1.wip.expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WIP website</a>.</p>
            <p>The User agrees to use the Services in accordance with this Agreement and any accompanying documentation provided by WIP.</p>

            <h3>2. No Liability for Personal Data Handling</h3>
            <p>The User acknowledges and agrees that WIP is not responsible for the storage, transmission, or protection of personal data submitted by the User. WIP will not be held liable for any breaches of data security or unauthorized access that occur outside of WIP’s control, including any actions by third-party employers or other entities.</p>
            <p>For details on how <strong>WIP Solutions Inc.</strong> handles business clients (employers), please refer to the <strong>B2B Public Offer Agreement</strong> available <a href="https://www.notion.so/1628dd7d2af6805f851aec28d23853ef?pvs=25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. This Agreement and the B2B Agreement are cross-referenced to ensure that both employers and candidates understand the terms of their engagement with WIP.</p>

            <h3>3. User’s Obligation to Provide Accurate Information</h3>
            <p>By using the Services, the User agrees to provide complete, accurate, and truthful information in their profile, job applications, referrals, and any other communications with WIP or potential employers. The User is solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted.</p>
            <p>Including, but not limited to, the following: when referring a candidate for a vacancy, the User confirms that they have obtained explicit consent from the candidate for such a referral and that the candidate has not previously submitted their application for this specific vacancy to the employer either directly or through another referrer within last 90 days.</p>
            <p>If, after submitting the referral, it is found that these conditions have not been met, WIP will not refund the staked amount to the User. If the referred candidate would be hired by the employer, WIP will not pay the Bounty to the User.</p>

            <h3>4. Permission to Store, Share, and Use Information</h3>
            <p>The User grants WIP permission to store, transmit, and use the information they provide for recruitment purposes. This includes sharing the User’s resume, contact details, and other relevant information with potential employers or third parties involved in the recruitment process. The User agrees that WIP may store and process their data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

            <h3>5. KYC Verification</h3>
            <p>All Users (also referred to as Talents, Referrers, Employer Representatives or Individual Users) are required to complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification procedure provided by WIP. This procedure is conducted by an external KYC service provider, who is solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of the personal data collected during the KYC process. WIP (WIP Solutions Inc.) assumes no liability for the storage, security, or unauthorized distribution of personal data managed by the KYC service provider.</p>

            <h3>6. Service Provider’s (WIP’s) Obligations</h3>
            <p>WIP agrees to provide job listings and recruitment-related services to the User. However, WIP does not guarantee the availability of specific job opportunities, hiring outcomes, or employer actions. WIP reserves the right to modify or remove job postings at its discretion.</p>

            <h3>7. Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>The <strong>User</strong> agrees to stake a specified amount when referring a candidate for a vacancy or submitting their resume (the "Stake").</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For each referral submission the User must stake an amount specified on a dedicated WIP page.</li>
              <li>If the referred candidate is invited by the employer for an interview and attended it, the staked amount will be fully refunded.</li>
              <li>If the position is filled within 10 working days from the User’s referral submission the staked amount will be fully refunded.</li>
              <li>The Stake is considered a non-refundable payment in all other cases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To cancel a referral, the User must submit a request to WIP (by clicking the “?” button in the bottom right corner on the website or by other suitable means). The Stake for canceled referral is non-refundable.</p>

            <h3>8. Bounty Payout</h3>
            <p>After Employer’s decision to hire the Candidate, the Bounty specified to the vacancy in question will be processed on following terms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>KYC Requirement:</strong> If the User has not completed the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure within 14 days from the submission of their referral, no portion of the Bounty will be paid, even if the Referred Candidate is successfully hired. <br>KYC procedure is required to be completed only once per User.</li>
              <li><strong>Bounty’s Payment schedule for the User’s successful Referral:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>20%</strong> of the total Bounty amount is paid upon the candidate’s official start date. The amount is paid only after WIP receives the Success Fee payment from the hiring employer, and its disbursement remains at the discretion of WIP.</li>
                  <li><strong>80%</strong> of the total Bounty amount will be paid in case the candidate remains employed by the Employer within 90 days from the candidate’s official start date.</li>
                  <li>In all other cases 80% of the bounty will not be paid.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Self-Referral:</strong> If the User refers themselves for a vacancy, and they are subsequently hired and remains employed by the Employer within 90 days from the official start date, WIP will pay the User 10% of the Bounty amount specified to the vacancy in question.</li>
              <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> WIP will notify the User when the Referred Candidate has been hired and their employment status with the Employer within a 90 days period from official starting date.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The decision to pay out the Bounty remains at WIP's sole discretion until the platform implements and launches its blockchain-based referral engine. By referring candidates through the Services, the User accepts these terms.</p>
            <p>WIP will not make payments to countries that are subject to sanctions imposed by the United States or the European Union.</p>

            <h3>9. Limitation of Liability and Services</h3>
            <p>The service is currently in prototype mode and may contain minor errors or inaccuracies. Without user consent, WIP reserves the right to modify the service unilaterally—including introducing new features, fixing errors, and adjusting business processes. WIP will continue to enhance and refine the service throughout its development.</p>
            <p>WIP shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of employment opportunities, data, or misuse of personal information arising out of or in connection with the use of the Services, whether in an action in contract or tort, even if WIP has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall WIP’s total liability exceed one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100).</p>
            <p>Additionally, WIP shall not be held responsible for the completeness, accuracy, or timeliness of the information provided by the employer in the job vacancy descriptions.

WIP may display the Client’s name and logo on its website, in marketing materials, and in any communications relating to the Services. The Client may revoke this license at any time by providing written notice to WIP.</p>

            <h3>3. Client’s Preferred Communication Channel</h3>
            <p>The Client is required to specify its preferred communication channel (e.g., email, phone, or messaging platform) for all official communication with WIP. WIP will use the specified channel for all communications related to service updates, inquiries, and requests. The Client is responsible for ensuring that the preferred communication channel is accurate and up to date.</p>

            <h3>4. Client’s Obligation to Provide Feedback</h3>
            <p>The Client agrees to provide written feedback to WIP regarding candidates and services received:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Candidate Feedback:</strong> The Client is obligated to inform WIP about the outcome of the interview process with each candidate referred by the Service. This includes whether the candidate was hired and whether they successfully completed the probationary period, if applicable.</li>
              <li><strong>Vacancy Status:</strong> The Client must notify WIP if a vacancy has been filled through another provider or by other means, as soon as such information becomes available. This is to ensure proper vacancy tracking and resource allocation.</li>
              <li><strong>Service Quality Feedback:</strong> The Client is also required to provide feedback on the quality of the services received to enable continuous improvement and effective collaboration.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>The Client agrees to pay WIP according to the pricing structure in effect at the time of service activation. The pricing structure consists of:</p>
            <h3>5.1 Job Posting Fees</h3>
            <p>The Client pays a one-time fee for each job vacancy posted on the platform. The fee amount depends on the Client's pricing tier:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Starter</strong> (fewer than 5 active jobs): $75 per job posting</li>
              <li><strong>Explorer</strong> (fewer than 25 active jobs): $59 per job posting</li>
              <li><strong>Professional</strong> (26 or more active jobs): $42 per job posting</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5.2 Monthly Maintenance Fees</h3>
            <p>After the initial free period, the Client pays a monthly fee for each active job posting:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Starter tier:</strong> $15 per job per month (starting from the 4th month)</li>
              <li><strong>Explorer tier:</strong> $13 per job per month (starting from the 4th month)</li>
              <li><strong>Professional tier:</strong> $10 per job per month (starting from the 5th month)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Monthly fees are charged on the anniversary date of the job posting. If a job posting is closed or filled before the monthly fee becomes due, no monthly fee is charged.</p>

            <h3>5.3 Success Fees</h3>
            <p>When a candidate referred by WIP is hired, the Client pays a Success Fee as described in Clause 6. The Success Fee percentage depends on the Client's pricing tier:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Starter tier:</strong> 15% of the agreed bounty amount (minimum $350)</li>
              <li><strong>Explorer tier:</strong> 14% of the agreed bounty amount (minimum $315)</li>
              <li><strong>Professional tier:</strong> 13% of the agreed bounty amount (minimum $250)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.4 Pricing Tier Assignment</h3>
            <p>The Client's pricing tier is automatically determined by the number of active job postings at the time each new job is posted. WIP will notify the Client of their current tier and applicable rates through the Client's preferred communication channel.</p>

            <h3>5.5 Promotional Offers</h3>
            <p>WIP may offer promotional pricing from time to time, including waived posting fees, extended free maintenance periods, or reduced success fees. Promotional terms will be communicated to eligible Clients and will take precedence over standard pricing for the duration specified in the promotion.</p>

            <h3>5.6 Changes to Pricing Structure</h3>
            <p>WIP reserves the right to modify the pricing structure for its services. Such changes may include adjusting the fees listed above or introducing new fee types, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fees for providing user accounts or "seats" for the Client's employees</li>
              <li>Additional premium features or services</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Success Fee</h3>
            <p>When posting a job vacancy, the Client is required to specify the amount of the Success Fee by submitting a signed letter of acceptance to WIP. That will be paid to WIP for any successful candidate referral:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the event that a candidate provided by WIP is hired, the Client agrees to pay 100% of the Success Fee to WIP within 10 calendar days from the start date of the Candidate.</li>
              <li>If the candidate doesn't remain employed within 90 days from the start date, WIP will issue a 100% refund of the success fee to the Client within 30 days upon receiving a notification from the Client accompanied by supporting documentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Success Fee amount must be set at the time of job posting, and it is the Client's responsibility to ensure that the Success Fee is paid promptly and in accordance with the terms outlined in this Agreement.</p>
            <p>The Success Fee is payable if the candidate starts working for the Client within 180 days from the last interaction between WIP and the Client concerning this candidate, regardless of the actual position the candidate is hired for.</p>
            <p>The Success Fee amount is determined based on the vacancy for which the Client initially accepted WIP's candidate recommendation.</p>
            <p>An exception applies in cases where a candidate provided through WIP is already under consideration by the Client for this specific vacancy and communication with the candidate has taken place within the last two months. In such cases, the Client (employer) must submit a rejection notice to WIP, accompanied by documentation confirming that the candidate is already under review, within 7 days from the moment of receiving the candidate referral from WIP.</p>
            <p>WIP will not make payments to countries that are subject to sanctions imposed by the United States or the European Union.</p>

            <h3>7. Service Provider's (WIP's) Obligations</h3>
            <p>WIP agrees to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Posting Vacancies:</strong> Publish job vacancies provided by the Client without modification of the job description, requirements, or terms unless expressly authorized by the Client. WIP shall not distort the Client's vacancy details or conditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Service Changes Notification:</strong> Notify the Client in a timely manner about any changes in the terms of service, including changes in pricing or the structure of services offered.</li>
              <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Use the Client's preferred communication channel, as specified, to transmit all relevant information, including updates on candidates, service adjustments, and other important notifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>The parties agree to keep all confidential information received from each other in connection with this Agreement secure and to not disclose such information to any third parties without prior written consent, except where required by law or for the purposes of performing the Services.</p>

            <h3>9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States. Any disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware, United States.</p>

            <h3>10. Termination</h3>
            <p>Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days' written notice. WIP may immediately suspend or terminate the Services if the Client breaches any terms of this Agreement or engages in unlawful activity while using the Services.</p>
            <p>The Client agrees to pay for all services provided by WIP, including but not limited to any Success Fee for candidates referred by WIP prior to the termination of services date.</p>
            <p>By using the Services, the Client acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

            <h3>11. No Liability for Personal Data Handling</h3>
            <p>The Client acknowledges and agrees that the WIP is not responsible for the storage, transmission, or handling of any personal data that the Client may process through the Services. The Client assumes full responsibility for compliance with applicable data protection laws and agrees that the WIP shall not be held liable for any data breaches, unauthorized access, or distribution of personal data that occurs outside of the WIP's infrastructure or control.</p>

            <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>The service is currently in prototype mode and may contain minor errors or inaccuracies. Without user consent, WIP reserves the right to modify the service unilaterally—including introducing new features, fixing errors, and adjusting business processes. WIP will continue to enhance and refine the service throughout its development.</p>
            <p>WIP shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages — including loss of profits, revenue, or data — arising from the use of the Services.
